## AI/ML

### 1. 🔴 ggml.ai joins Hugging Face to ensure the long-term progress of Local AI

Hugging Face acquired ggml.ai (creator of llama.cpp that democratized local LLM inference on consumer hardware) with plans for single-click integration between Transformers library and GGML ecosystem. This could enable model releases that work with local inference out-of-the-box, eliminating the current friction of running models locally.

### 2. Taalas serves Llama 3.1 8B at 17,000 tokens/second

Canadian startup Taalas achieved 17,000 tokens/second inference with Llama 3.1 8B using custom hardware and aggressive 3-bit/6-bit quantization. This represents a significant breakthrough in local LLM inference speed, potentially making real-time applications viable without cloud dependencies.

### 3. Andrej Karpathy talks about "Claws"

Andrej Karpathy identifies "Claws" as an emerging category for OpenClaw-like AI agent systems that run on personal hardware with messaging protocols and task scheduling capabilities, representing a new orchestration layer above LLM agents. Multiple implementations are already appearing (NanoClaw, zeroclaw, ironclaw) with NanoClaw notable for its manageable ~4000 line codebase that runs everything in containers.

### 4. Quoting Thibault Sottiaux

OpenAI's Thibault Sottiaux reports a 30% performance boost for GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, now serving over 1200 tokens/second—a significant inference speed improvement that reduces latency for code generation workloads.
