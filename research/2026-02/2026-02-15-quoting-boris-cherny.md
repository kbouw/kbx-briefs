# Boris Cherny on AI Coding and the Evolving Role of Engineers

## Executive Summary

Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code at Anthropic, has made headlines by revealing that 100% of his code has been AI-written for over two months, yet he argues engineers remain more crucial than ever. His core thesis: engineering is evolving from writing code to orchestrating AI systems, customer interaction, cross-team coordination, and strategic product decisions.

> **Confidence: High** ✅ — Multiple independent sources confirm Cherny's statements, with company-wide data from Anthropic supporting his claims (70-90% AI-generated code company-wide, ~90% for Claude Code itself).

## Key Findings

### The 100% AI Code Claim
- **Personal workflow**: Cherny reports zero manual code edits for 2+ months, shipping 22-27 PRs daily, all 100% Claude-generated
- **Company-wide reality**: Anthropic spokesperson confirms 70-90% AI-generated code across the company
- **Claude Code eating its own dogfood**: ~90% of Claude Code's codebase is written by Claude Code itself
- **Industry context**: This puts Anthropic significantly ahead of Microsoft (~30%) and Salesforce (similar figures)

### The "Engineers Still Needed" Argument
Cherny's central quote captures his perspective: *"Someone has to prompt the Claudes, talk to customers, coordinate with other teams, decide what to build next. Engineering is changing and great engineers are more important than ever."*

**Four core remaining functions:**
1. **AI Orchestration**: Prompting and directing AI systems effectively
2. **Customer Interface**: Understanding user needs and translating requirements
3. **Cross-team Coordination**: Managing dependencies and architectural decisions
4. **Product Strategy**: Deciding what to build and why

### Workflow Evolution
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Cherny runs 5-10 simultaneous Claude instances with "teleport" commands to hand off sessions
- **Plan Mode emphasis**: Uses structured planning for non-trivial development work
- **CLAUDE.md files**: Maintains accumulated learnings and context for AI systems
- **Review as meta-work**: Code review becomes about improving the AI development process, not just catching bugs

## Technical Details

### Hiring Strategy Shifts
- **Generalists over specialists**: Traditional programming skills less relevant when AI handles implementation
- **New skill priorities**: Product thinking, customer empathy, communication, and strategic decision-making now more valued
- **"Side quest" preference**: Cherny favors hiring engineers with diverse interests (example given: kombucha making), suggesting value in well-rounded generalists

### Production Reality vs. Marketing
- **Quality concerns acknowledged**: Andrej Karpathy notes AI can make "subtle conceptual errors," over-complicate code, and leave dead code
- **Productivity gains confirmed**: Engineers report feeling "unshackled" from tedious work, able to focus on creative problem-solving
- **Timeline predictions**: Industry may see similar 70-90% AI code generation "in coming months," with non-coding computer work following

### Industry Impact
- **Entry-level positions**: Open roles for junior developers declining as AI coding tools proliferate
- **Role evolution**: Engineers becoming "orchestra conductors" rather than individual implementers
- **Democratization claims**: Tech companies argue AI will allow non-technical users to build products through natural language prompting

## Implications for Tech Leaders

**Near-term strategic considerations:**
- Traditional coding interview processes may become less predictive of performance
- Investment in AI tooling and workflow optimization becomes critical competitive advantage  
- Team structure should emphasize product sense and cross-functional collaboration skills
- Training programs need to shift from syntax mastery to effective AI direction

**Longer-term workforce planning:**
- Junior developer career paths require fundamental rethinking
- Mid-level engineers without strong fundamentals may face the greatest retraining challenge
- Value increasingly concentrated in engineers who can bridge technical implementation with business strategy

**Technology adoption timeline:**
- Leading AI companies are 6-12 months ahead of broader industry adoption curves
- Companies not actively experimenting with AI coding workflows risk competitive disadvantage
- Infrastructure and process changes needed to support high-volume AI-generated code deployment
