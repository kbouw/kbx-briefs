StrongDM's AI team achieved "Dark Factory" development where agents write and deploy code without human review, using "Digital Twin Universe" clones of services like Okta and Slack for validation and scenario-based testing instead of traditional code review. Their rule of spending $1,000+ on tokens per engineer daily demonstrates the economic shift needed to make AI-first development viable at enterprise scale.
