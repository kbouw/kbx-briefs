### 1. 🔴 Opus 4.6 and Codex 5.3

Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.6 and OpenAI released GPT-5.3-Codex within 15 minutes of each other, but both show only incremental improvements over their predecessors. The most notable capability demonstration is Nicholas Carlini using parallel Claude instances to build a C compiler, replicating Cursor's FastRender approach.
