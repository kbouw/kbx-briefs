# Daily Intelligence Brief — February 20, 2026

## AI/ML

### 1. 🔴 Gemini 3.1 Pro

Google released Gemini 3.1 Pro at $2/$12 per million tokens—less than half Claude Opus 4.6's price with similar benchmark scores—showcasing dramatically improved SVG animation capabilities, including generating complex animated scenes like pelicans riding bicycles that previous models couldn't handle.

**Tags:** Gemini 3.1 Pro, SVG generation, model pricing

### 2. The path to ubiquitous AI (17k tokens/sec)

Analysis demonstrates achieving 17,000 tokens/second inference performance represents a critical threshold for ubiquitous AI deployment, enabling real-time applications that were previously computationally infeasible. This performance milestone unlocks new categories of AI applications including live conversation, real-time code generation, and interactive content creation at human-perceived instantaneous speeds.

### 3. Quoting Thariq Shihipar

Anthropic's Thariq Shihipar reveals that Claude Code's viability as a long-running agentic product depends entirely on prompt caching to reuse computation across roundtrips, with cache hit rates monitored so closely that low rates trigger SEV incidents due to their direct impact on costs and user rate limits.
