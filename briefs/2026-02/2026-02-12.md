## AI/ML

### 1. 🔴 GLM-5: From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering

GLM-5 launches as a massive 754B parameter MIT-licensed model (double GLM-4's size at 1.51TB), while Z.ai pushes "Agentic Engineering" as the term for professional LLM-assisted development—a concept also endorsed by Andrej Karpathy and Addy Osmani.

**Tags:** GLM-5, model release, agentic engineering, LLM

### 2. Skills in OpenAI API

OpenAI API now supports Skills via inline base64-encoded zip data in JSON requests, allowing developers to package and execute custom tools directly within API calls using the new shell tool interface. The author demonstrates this by having Claude Code use Showboat to explore and build demos of the API functionality.

**Tags:** OpenAI API, Skills, GPT-5.2, Claude Code

### 3. Duct-taping AI coding tools together

AI coding tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenCode each use incompatible directory structures for project rules and workflows, forcing developers to use filesystem symlinks as a workaround. Ironically, Anthropic co-founded the AGENTS.md standard but their own Claude Code ignores it despite 2,500+ upvotes requesting support.

### 4. Quoting Andrew Deck for Niemen Lab

The New York Times built an internal 'Manosphere Report' tool using LLMs to automatically transcribe and summarize dozens of podcasts, which provided early signals that conservative media was turning against the administration and directly informed their coverage decisions.
