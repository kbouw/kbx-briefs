## AI/ML

### 1. Structured Context Engineering for File-Native Agentic Systems

McMillan's 9,649-experiment study reveals that frontier models (Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro) significantly outperform open-source models at filesystem-based context retrieval for large SQL schemas, and that token-optimized formats like TOON backfire due to model unfamiliarity causing expensive multi-iteration parsing attempts.

**Tags:** context-engineering, SQL-generation, file-native-agents, TOON

### 2. AI Doesn’t Reduce Work—It Intensifies It

Berkeley researchers studying 200 tech workers found AI creates unsustainable work intensity—enabling parallel task juggling and constant context switching that feels productive but causes rapid mental exhaustion and burnout. Organizations need structured 'AI practices' to distinguish genuine productivity gains from destructive work patterns that disrupt decades of sustainable working intuitions.
