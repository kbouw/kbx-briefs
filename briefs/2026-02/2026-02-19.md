# Daily Intelligence Brief — February 19, 2026

## AI/ML

### 1. SWE-bench February 2026 leaderboard update

Independent SWE-bench evaluation shows Claude Opus 4.5 leading coding performance over newer 4.6 version, with Chinese models (MiniMax M2.5, GLM-5, DeepSeek V3.2) claiming 5 of top 10 spots while OpenAI's GPT-5.2 ranks only 6th. This third-party validation matters because it avoids self-reported benchmark gaming by labs.

### 2. The A.I. Disruption We’ve Been Waiting for Has Arrived

Paul Ford quantifies AI coding's cost disruption: tasks he'd previously charge $350K for as CEO of consultancy Postlight now take weekends with Claude's $200/month plan, with November marking the inflection point where AI went from "halting and clumsy" to building credible full applications in hour-long sessions.
