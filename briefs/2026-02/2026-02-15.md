## AI/ML

### 1. Two different tricks for fast LLM inference

Anthropic's fast mode achieves 2.5x speedup by reducing batch sizes on existing hardware (serving real Claude Opus 4.6), while OpenAI's 15x speedup uses Cerebras's 44GB SRAM chips that require a smaller distilled model (GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark). The tradeoff: Anthropic preserves full model capability at higher cost, OpenAI sacrifices capability for dramatic speed gains.

### 2. How Generative and Agentic AI Shift Concern from Technical Debt to Cognitive Debt

Margaret-Anne Storey identifies "cognitive debt" as the key risk of AI-assisted coding—when developers lose understanding of their system's design decisions and interactions even if the generated code is clean, paralyzing teams who can no longer make confident changes without breaking unexpected components.

### 3. Quoting Boris Cherny

Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code at Anthropic, argues that despite AI coding tools, engineers remain crucial for prompting AI systems, customer interaction, cross-team coordination, and product decisions—shifting the role rather than eliminating it.
