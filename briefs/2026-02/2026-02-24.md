### 1. Writing code is cheap now

Coding agents have made writing code nearly free, but producing good code—working, tested, documented, maintainable—still requires significant human oversight and new engineering habits. The key shift is questioning instincts about what's "worth building" and experimenting with asynchronous agent sessions for previously dismissed ideas.

### 2. Ladybird adopts Rust, with help from AI

Andreas Kling used Claude Code and Codex to port Ladybird's 25,000-line JavaScript engine from C++ to Rust in 2 weeks versus months manually, achieving byte-for-byte identical output with zero regressions. The key was having comprehensive conformance tests (test262) and human-directed prompting rather than autonomous generation.

### 3. Writing about Agentic Engineering Patterns

Software engineer launches structured documentation project for "Agentic Engineering Patterns"—professional practices for using coding agents like Claude Code that can generate, execute, and iterate on code independently. First patterns include treating code as cheap-to-generate and using red/green TDD to help agents write more reliable code with minimal prompting.
