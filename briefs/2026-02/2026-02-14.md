### 2. The evolution of OpenAI's mission statement

OpenAI's IRS tax filings reveal systematic erosion of safety commitments and open research principles from 2016-2024, culminating in 2024's drastically shortened mission that drops all mentions of safety, open sharing, and being "unconstrained by financial return." The evolution from building AI "as part of a larger community" to simply ensuring AGI "benefits all of humanity" signals a fundamental shift in organizational priorities.
