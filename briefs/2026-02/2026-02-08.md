## AI/ML

### 1. 🔴 How StrongDM's AI team build serious software without even looking at the code

StrongDM's AI team achieved "Dark Factory" development where agents write and deploy code without human review, using "Digital Twin Universe" clones of services like Okta and Slack for validation and scenario-based testing instead of traditional code review. Their rule of spending $1,000+ on tokens per engineer daily demonstrates the economic shift needed to make AI-first development viable at enterprise scale.

### 2. Show HN: LocalGPT – A local-first AI assistant in Rust with persistent memory

Developer created LocalGPT, a 27MB Rust binary that reimplements OpenClaw's markdown-based persistent memory pattern with local embeddings and autonomous task running—eliminating Node.js/Docker dependencies while maintaining compatibility. The key insight: memory compounds across sessions, making each interaction more valuable than stateless chat interfaces.
