# Daily Intelligence Brief — February 16, 2026

## AI/ML

### 1. 🔴 Three months of OpenClaw

OpenClaw exploded from first commit to 10K commits and 196K GitHub stars in under 3 months, with creator Peter Steinberger now joining OpenAI and transferring the viral agent framework to an independent foundation. The hype reached Super Bowl commercial levels with AI.com's $70m domain purchase, though their implementation appears to be vaporware.

### 3. The AI Vampire

Steve Yegge warns that AI productivity gains create a "vampire" effect where companies capture 100% of the value while developers get burned out from cognitive overload—he recommends limiting agentic work to 4 hours daily in short bursts. The core insight: AI automates easy work but leaves humans with all the hardest decisions and problem-solving, creating unsustainable mental load.

### 4. Deep Blue

Adam Leventhal and Bryan Cantrill coin "Deep Blue" to describe the psychological ennui software developers feel as AI coding agents like Claude Opus and GPT-5 demonstrate ability to produce working, tested software matching specifications. The term references how chess players overcame similar existential dread when Deep Blue defeated Kasparov in 1997, suggesting developers will adapt and find new value despite AI encroachment.
